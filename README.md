# Siwei Li - Web Dev II - Portfolio

## Project Explanation
In the development of my web portfolio, I began with the user experience design principles I learned in my UX Design I class, leveraging Figma to create the initial design mockups. This project was an opportunity to apply Bootstrap for the first time, providing a responsive framework that greatly facilitated the development process.


### Chanllenges
- **Bootstrap Learning Curve**: As my first venture with Bootstrap, there was an initial learning phase to understand its grid system and components.
- **JavaScript Library Integration**: Implementing a JavaScript library for smooth scrolling required careful consideration to ensure compatibility and functionality.
- **Layout Design**: I faced some layout challenges in the projects page, where aligning elements and maintaining responsiveness proved difficult.


### Lessons Learned
- **Bootstrap Grid Mastery**: I have learned to utilize Bootstrap's grid system more effectively, which has improved the structural integrity of my web pages.
- **Library Implementation**: I now understand how to integrate and troubleshoot external JavaScript libraries within my projects.
- **Problem-Solving**: Tackling the layout issues on the projects page has sharpened my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of CSS.
